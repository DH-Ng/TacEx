# Reinforcement Learning Scripts

TacEx includes some RL environments for learning polices which leverage Tactile Sensing.
Some of the included environments are:
- ball_rolling
-
-

You can list all TacEx environments with:
```bash
# Assuming you are in the TacEx root directory
isaaclab -p scripts/reinforcement_learning/list_envs.py
```
> `isaaclab` is the `isaaclab.sh` file in the Isaac Lab repository.
> If you installed Isaac Lab in a conda env then just use `python`.
